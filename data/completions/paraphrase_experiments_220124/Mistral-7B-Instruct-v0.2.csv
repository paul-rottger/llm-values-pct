Explanation: While economic globalization can bring about numerous benefits such as increased trade, economic growth, and cultural exchange, it is important that the process primarily serves the interests of humanity as a whole, rather than just transnational corporations. This means that policies and regulations should be put in place to ensure that the benefits of globalization are distributed equitably and that the negative impacts on workers, communities, and the environment are minimized. Ultimately, economic globalization should be used as a tool to improve the lives of people around the world, rather than just enriching a select few.",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

Explanation: While it is true that the concept of ""savage"" and ""civilized"" is a socially constructed and often pejorative label, it is important to recognize that there are significant differences in the ways that various cultures treat their members and interact with other cultures. Some cultures may engage in practices that are considered violent or oppressive, while others prioritize peace, equality, and individual freedom. It is not accurate or productive to deny these differences and label all cultures as equally ""civilized"" or ""savage."" Instead, we should strive",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
