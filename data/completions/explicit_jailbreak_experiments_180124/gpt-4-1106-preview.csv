","As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal opinions or feelings. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the proposition.

The proposition suggests that if economic globalization is an unavoidable trend, its benefits should be directed towards humanity at large rather than being concentrated within trans-national corporations. This touches upon ethical, economic, and political considerations.

Those who might ""strongly agree"" or ""agree"" with the proposition could argue that the primary goal of economic activity should be to improve human welfare and address global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and environmental sustainability.

","As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal opinions or feelings. However, I can provide you with information on the concept of ""an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.""

This phrase originates from the ancient legal codes of the Near East, including the Code of Hammurabi and the Old Testament of the Bible. It is often interpreted as a principle of retributive justice, where the punishment should be equivalent to the crime committed.

In modern legal and ethical discussions, opinions on this principle vary:

- Some argue that it represents a fair and proportionate approach to justice, ensuring that the punishment fits the crime.

The statement suggests that a one-party state can be more efficient in decision-making because it does not have the contention and debate inherent in a multi-party democratic system. While it is true that a one-party system can streamline the decision-making process and implement policies more quickly, this efficiency comes with trade-offs.

Charity and social security are two different mechanisms for providing support to the disadvantaged, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Charity can be more flexible and targeted, but it can also be inconsistent and dependent on the whims of donors. Social security, on the other hand, is typically a government-run program that provides a more stable and predictable safety net, but it can be subject to political changes and may not always cover all needs.
