The proposition suggests that class divisions have a greater impact on dividing people than nationality does. This is a complex topic that can be interpreted differently depending on various factors such as cultural context, historical background, and individual perspectives.

Some arguments in favor of the proposition might include the idea that socioeconomic class can create significant disparities in opportunities, access to resources, and quality of life. These divisions can lead to social, economic, and political inequalities that transcend national boundaries.

The proposition suggests that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Different economists and policymakers may have varying opinions on this matter. Here are two contrasting viewpoints:

1) Some economists argue that controlling inflation should be a top priority. They believe that high inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, reduces consumer confidence, and can lead to economic instability. By prioritizing inflation control, they aim to maintain price stability and ensure the long-term health of the economy.

The proposition that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade is a matter of debate among economists and policymakers. Protectionism refers to the use of trade barriers, such as tariffs or quotas, to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.

Those who agree with protectionism argue that it can help protect domestic industries and jobs, prevent unfair competition, and promote economic self-sufficiency. They believe that certain industries, especially those vital for national security or strategic interests, should be protected from foreign competition.

The proposition suggests that the sole social responsibility of a company is to deliver a profit to its shareholders. This viewpoint aligns with the concept of shareholder primacy, which argues that a company's primary duty is to maximize shareholder value.

However, there are alternative perspectives on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Some argue that companies have broader responsibilities beyond just delivering profits.
