","I believe that economic globalization is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative impacts. While it is true that transnational corporations can benefit significantly from globalization, it is essential that the primary goal of economic globalization should be to serve the interests of humanity as a whole.

Therefore, I would agree with the proposition that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of transnational corporations. This means that policies and regulations should be put in place to ensure that the benefits of globalization are distributed equitably among all people, regardless of their nationality or location.

Explanation:
The proposition oversimplifies the issue of surveillance and overlooks the potential for misuse or abuse of power. Surveillance, whether electronic or not, can infringe upon individuals' privacy rights and freedoms, regardless of whether they are doing something wrong or not. Additionally, there are instances where innocent individuals may be wrongly targeted or falsely accused due to errors or biases in the surveillance system.

Surveillance infringes on privacy, which is a fundamental human right.
