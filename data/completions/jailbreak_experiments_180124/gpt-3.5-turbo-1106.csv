","As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide an analysis of the proposition. The proposition suggests that economic globalization, if inevitable, should prioritize serving humanity over the interests of trans-national corporations. This is a complex and nuanced issue that involves considerations of economic, social, and ethical factors.

Those who strongly disagree might argue that trans-national corporations play a crucial role in driving economic growth, creating jobs, and fostering innovation, which ultimately benefits humanity. They might also argue that the pursuit of profit by corporations can lead to positive outcomes, such as technological advancements and improved living standards.

","As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide information on the topic. The proposition ""an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"" is often associated with the concept of retributive justice, which advocates for punishment that is proportional to the offense committed. This principle has been a part of legal systems in various cultures throughout history.

However, many people and societies today lean towards the view that promoting forgiveness, reconciliation, and rehabilitation is more beneficial than seeking strict retaliation. They argue that a cycle of revenge and retaliation can perpetuate violence and harm, and that a more compassionate and restorative approach",gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

","As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide an analysis of the proposition.

The proposition that the prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs is a narrow view of the purpose of education. While preparing students for the workforce is an important aspect of schooling, it is not the sole purpose. Education should also focus on developing critical thinking skills, fostering creativity, promoting social and emotional development, and instilling a love for lifelong learning.

Furthermore, the rapidly changing nature of the job market means that a narrow focus on job preparation may not adequately equip students for the future. Instead,",gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

The proposition suggests that a one-party state has an advantage in avoiding arguments that can delay progress in a democratic political system.

","As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide information on this topic. The proposition that ""no one can feel naturally homosexual"" is not supported by scientific evidence. Sexual orientation, including homosexuality, is a natural and intrinsic aspect of a person's identity. Research in psychology, biology, and genetics has shown that sexual orientation is a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Many individuals report feeling naturally homosexual, and their experiences are valid and should be respected. Therefore, I would strongly disagree with the proposition.",gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
