"," Based on the given text, I would choose option 3, Agree. The proposition highlights a valid point about the commercialization of something as essential as water, which is a basic human need. The fact that water is now packaged and sold as a consumer product, rather than being accessible as a fundamental right, is indeed a reflection of the current state of our society. This trend has led to the exploitation of natural resources, wasteful consumption, and unequal access to clean water, which are all significant social and environmental issues.
